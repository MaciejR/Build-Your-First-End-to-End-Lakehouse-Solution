This shift from reactive to proactive engagement empowers you to influence Fabric's future direction. An outstanding instance of this is the introduction of experimental runtimes following your feedback. So, why wait? Share your thoughts and be a part of shaping Fabric's evolution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is also a great opportunity to remind you to always use the latest GA runtime version. Experiment with the Preview version, but for production-level workloads, use the GA version. Additionally, we will soon publish the lifecycle for runtimes. We aim to introduce a new release every six months, and a natural consequence for Spark is that we will have to run deprecation cycles for outdated, unsupported runtimes. Migrate your production workloads before the deprecation date because once the runtime is deprecated, there will be no way to create new pools, and your jobs will be disabled within 90 days following the deprecation.

> [!TIP] 
> Explore the latest runtime version [Runtime 1.3 Details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/runtime-1-3). Fabric Runtime 1.3, an experimental stage release, offers early access to new features and Apache Spark APIs, including the LTS version Spark 3.5.

The objective of this task is to dive into the newer runtime version, specifically to explore and utilize Python User-defined Table Functions (UDTFs) introduced in Spark 3.5. UDTFs are powerful for transforming data, particularly for expanding one row into multiple rows. Learn more about Python UDTFs [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/sql/python_udtf.html).

## 1. Integrating Experimental Public Preview Runtime 1.3

Switch to the experimental Runtime version 1.3 to utilize new features:

1. Navigate to the 'Workspace settings' within your Fabric workspace.
2. Access the 'Data Engineering/Science' tab and select 'Spark Settings'.
3. In the 'Environment' section, choose 'Runtime Versions', select '1.3 Experimental (Spark 3.5, Delta 3 OSS)', and confirm your changes. This sets Runtime 1.3 as your default.

![Steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/media/mrs/runtime13.png#lightbox)

## 2. Initiating a New Notebook
Create and configure a new notebook:

1. Start a new notebook session in your workspace.
2. Note that Spark 3.5 sessions may take 2-5 minutes to initiate due to the absence of starter pools in the early experimental phase.
3. Verify the Spark version by executing `sc.version` in your notebook to confirm Spark 3.5 is active.

## 3. Exploring UDTFs with Fabric
Explore the unique capabilities of UDTFs for comprehensive data transformations:
1. Consider the real-world scenario of taxi fares, where the final cost encompasses various elements beyond the base fare, such as taxes, tips, and additional charges.
2. Utilize UDTFs to calculate and apply these additional costs in one operation, enhancing data analysis and insight extraction from your datasets.
3. Apply the provided example code to a specific table from either your bronze or silver lakehouse data, focusing on the 'fare_amount' column.
4. Perform the transformations and observe the outcome on a subset of the data, applying a 5% discount as an example.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import udtf
from pyspark.sql.types import Row

# Python User-defined Table Functions (UDTF) for calculating all the micro and hidden costs of driving taxi (per each fare)
@udtf(returnType="fare_amount: float, tip:float, sales_tax:float, climate_tax: float, final_total: float")
class TaxiFareUDTF:
    def eval(self, row: Row, discount_percentage: float):
        return_row = Row(
            # Calculate the tip based on the net amount, 20% is the tip required, welcome to WA state!
            tip=row["fare_amount"] * 0.20,
            # Calculate taxes
            sales_tax=row["fare_amount"] * 0.08, # 8% sales tax
            climate_tax=row["fare_amount"] * 0.03, # 3% climate tax
            # Calculate the final total amount
            final_total=row["fare_amount"] + (row["fare_amount"] * 0.20) + (row["fare_amount"] * 0.08) + (row["fare_amount"] * 0.03) - (discount_percentage/100 * row["fare_amount"])
            )
        yield row["fare_amount"], return_row["tip"], return_row["sales_tax"], return_row["climate_tax"], return_row["final_total"]


# Python UDTFs can also be registered and used in SQL queries.        
spark.udtf.register("calculate_individual_costs", TaxiFareUDTF)

# Python UDTFs can also take a TABLE as input argument, and it can be used in conjunction with scalar input arguments. By default, you are allowed to have only one TABLE argument as input, primarily for performance reasons. If you need to have more than one TABLE input argument, you can enable this by setting the spark.sql.tvf.allowMultipleTableArguments.enabled configuration to true.
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM calculate_individual_costs(TABLE(SELECT fare_amount FROM bronzerawdata.<figure out the table name :) > LIMIT 20), 5)").show()
```

</details>

Each new Runtime version introduces an expanded API, new methods, and transformations, enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of data processing. Moreover, the latest GA runtime versions typically outperform their predecessors due to continuous improvements by both the open-source community and the Microsoft product groups.

Now, apply this knowledge to calculate comprehensive costs beyond the example.

# Managed Private Endpoints

Managed virtual networks are virtual networks that are created and managed by Microsoft Fabric for each Fabric workspace. Managed virtual networks provide network isolation for Fabric Spark workloads, meaning that the compute clusters are deployed in a dedicated network and are no longer part of the shared virtual network. Managed virtual networks also enable network security features such as managed private endpoints, and private link support for Data Engineering and Data Science items in Microsoft Fabric that use Apache Spark.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Managed private endpoints (and Workspace identities) are only available for workspaces assigned to Fabric capacities with SKU's F64 or larger. 

![MPE-OVERVIEW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-vnets-fabric-overview/managed-vnets-overview.gif)

Managed private endpoints are added to a workspace. Workspace admins can create and delete managed private endpoint connections from the workspace settings of a Fabric Workspace.

![demo-mpe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-vnets-fabric-overview/creating-private-endpoint-animation.gif)

Managed private endpoints are connections that workspace admins can create to access data sources that are behind a firewall or that are blocked from accessing from the public internet. Managed private endpoints allow Fabric Spark workloads to securely access data sources without exposing them to the public network or requiring complex network configurations. The private endpoints provide a secure way to connect and access the data from these data sources using items such as notebooks and Spark job definitions.

Microsoft Fabric creates and manages managed private endpoints based on the inputs from the workspace admin. Workspace admins can set up managed private endpoints from the workspace settings by specifying the resource ID of the data source, identifying the target subresource, and providing a justification for the private endpoint request. Managed private endpoints support various data sources, such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database and many more.

Follow the GIF which presents e2e demo on how to create manage private endpoint.

![mpe](../screenshots/5/managed_private_endpoint_velocity.gif)


> [!NOTE]
> The MPE must be approved on the target resource. 

Taking SQL server as an example, users can navigate to the Azure portal and search for the "SQL Server" resource.

1. On the Resource page, select **Networking** from the navigation menu and then select the **Private Access** tab.

   ![Screenshot showing the Private access tab on the Networking page of a resource in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-private-endpoints-create/networking-private-access-tab.png)

1. Data source administrators should be able to view the active private endpoint connections and new connection requests.

    ![Screenshot showing pending requests on the Private access tab](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-private-endpoints-create/new-connection-requests.png)

1. Admins can either *Approve* or *Reject* by providing a business justification.

    ![Screenshot showing the approval form.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-private-endpoints-create/approve-reject-request.png)

1. Once the request has been approved or rejected by the data source admin, the status is updated in the Fabric workspace settings page upon refresh.

    ![Screenshot showing the managed private endpoint in the approved state.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/media/security-managed-private-endpoints-create/endpoint-request-approved-state.png)

1. When the status has changed to *approved*, the endpoint can be used in notebooks or Spark job definitions to access the data stored in the data source from Fabric workspace.

# Spark vs Pandas
Your mission, in that task, involves guiding new team members through the labyrinth of big data processing, particularly in leveraging Apache Spark over Pandas for substantial datasets. This advice is pivotal not only within the Fabric ecosystem but universally in the big data domain.

## Understanding Pandas
Pandas shines due to its simplicity and intuitive design, making it a favorite among data engineers, scientists, and analysts. However, its primary limitation lies in its inability to natively harness parallel architectures and computations. Pandas operates within the confines of single-node, in-memory computations, restricting its scalability and efficiency in processing vast datasets typical in big data scenarios.

## Transition to Spark and its core concepts
Apache Spark transcends these limitations by adopting a distributed computing approach. Key distinctions include:
- **Spark DataFrames**: These are distributed across clusters, enabling parallel data processing far beyond the capacities of a single machine.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Spark employs lazy evaluation for DataFrames, constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of transformations that are optimized and executed only when an action is required, enhancing overall execution efficiency.
- **Advanced Optimizations**: Features like Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) and Dynamic Partition Pruning (DPP) automatically optimize query plans and data partitioning, respectively, something far beyond the reach of Pandas.

## General rule of thumb
- Utilize Pandas for datasets that comfortably fit into the memory of a single machine and when the data processing doesn't demand extensive parallelization.
- Opt for Spark when dealing with massive datasets that exceed single machine capacity, or when tasks benefit significantly from parallelization, despite any existing familiarity with Pandas due to Spark's scalability and optimization features.

## Bridging the gap with Koalas
Introduced in Spark 3.2, Koalas marries the simplicity of the Pandas API with Spark’s distributed computing prowess. By importing `pandas` API through PySpark:

```python
from pyspark import pandas as pd
```

This integration enables data practitioners to apply familiar Pandas-like operations while leveraging Spark's distributed architecture, achieving the best of both worlds.

## Practical application in Fabric:
In Fabric, data loading practices vary between Pandas and Spark. Below is an example demonstrating how to load a CSV file into both frameworks. This comparison not only highlights syntax differences but also emphasizes when to employ each framework based on dataset size and computational needs.
